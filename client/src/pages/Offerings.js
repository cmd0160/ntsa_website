            <h2 className="py-3 center">NTSA Trophy Festival</h2>
            <p>
                Trophy Festival takes place annually at the end of February. The NTSA Trophy Festival will be hybridized in an effort to maximize access for the broad range of needs in
                our chapter’s community.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <h4 className="py-3 center">What is Trophy Festival?</h4>

                All guitar, piano, harp, violin, viola, cello, and bass students who currently study with an NTSA Member Suzuki teacher are invited to participate. The purpose of this event is to provide an opportunity for students to perform for a clinician/adjudicator and receive positive comments, clear and specific feedback, and a certificate or trophy - tangible evidence of their effort and accomplishments. This event serves as a terrific introduction for elementary students who will later perform in Solo/Ensemble Festivals and Region and Youth Orchestra Auditions; it is also perfect for more advanced or older students who want additional performing experience, particularly in video submission format, with valuable feedback in return. Proceeds from the Trophy Festival largely fund the NTSA’s Scholarship Fund. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Please reach out to our Trophy Festival Chair if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to seeing you and your studio
                participating!
                <br></br>
