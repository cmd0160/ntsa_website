            <h2 className="py-3 center">NTSA Trophy Festival</h2>
            <p>
                Trophy Festival takes place annually at the end of February. The NTSA Trophy Festival will be hybridized in an effort to maximize access for the broad range of needs in
                our chapter’s community.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Included below are letters to share with your studio families. Please note that the letters are
                distinguished by “Online” and “Physical Location.” The information is different, depending on the participant’s choice, so please be sure that your
                students are aware and read the appropriate letter.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Please also be aware that, in the “Physical Location” letter, there are two different registration
                forms– one for the Mid-Cities location and one for the North-Dallas location. Bringing this detail to your
                students’ attention will make the registration process smoother for everyone involved. I thank you in
                advance for your help in the process!

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Lastly, linked here is the new adjudication form, revisions led by Charles Krigbaum and the NTSA Board.
                This form adheres to the performance descriptors of the SAA and we encourage you to use this to guide
                your preparations for the Trophy Festival.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Please reach out to our Trophy Festival Chair if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to seeing you and your studio
                participating!
