          <h4 className="p-2">
            North Texas Suzuki Association Code of Ethics <br></br>
            Created by the NTSA Executive Committee, 2002
          </h4>
          <p className="left">
            This Code of Ethics was adopted by the North Texas Suzuki
            Associationâ€™s Board to standardize rules of conduct for Suzuki
            teachers in relation to pupils, parents, teachers, and the public.
            It shall be the obligation of every member to maintain the highest
            standards of moral and professional conduct and personal integrity,
            always keeping the best interest of children at heart.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            1. I will not recruit students who are currently studying with
            another teacher. Upon leaving a program or school, I will not
            solicit students who are enrolled by that program/school without the
            express consent of the director of the school/program.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            2. I will accept a student who wishes to transfer to my studio only
            after I have notified the prior teacher/school involved or with any
            teacher with whom the student has terminated lessons with in the
            past 3 months. I will not accept a student who has outstanding
            financial obligations to another teacher.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            3. I will not make negative comments regarding other
            teachers/studios in the presence of parents/student.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            4. If I have doubts concerning the competence and/or motives of
            another teacher, I will voice them to the teacher involved, or I
            will remain silent. I will not make negative comments regarding
            students/parents in the presence of other students/parents.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            5. I will continue to grow professionally through educational
            opportunities and through active participation in the music
            community. I will support my fellow colleagues who continue to
            educate themselves and grow through their contacts in the music
            community.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            6. As a Suzuki teacher, I use review, listening, group activities,
            weekly reading assignments, and parent involvement, where
            appropriate, to help develop talent and motivate my students.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            7. In advertising, I will adhere to facts reflective of my training,
            skills, and abilities as a Suzuki teacher. I will advise parents to
            check with SAA about the training records of teachers.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            8. If I present a transfer student in performance/competition who
            has studied fewer than 6 consecutive months with me, I will
            acknowledge the work of the former teacher.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            9. I realize that I have a heightened sense of responsibility when I
            share a Suzuki student or family with another Suzuki teacher and
            will observe strict adherence to the Code of Ethics, parent
            education, and the Suzuki Philosophy.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            10. I will abide by the SAA Code of Ethics.
